# What are we building?
This repository brings together a collection of projects to be developed mainly during the vacation period, with the goal of practicing fundamental and advanced concepts in the field of tech, exploring new technologies, and turning theoretical ideas into real-world implementations.

# Possible ideas
## 1. Public Notice and Bidding "Scanner" (GovTech)
### Description
Companies lose millions because they cannot read every Official Gazette to find contracts where they could sell their services.

### Project
Python downloads Official Gazette PDFs daily, uses OCR (if necessary) and AI to filter keywords (e.g., "computer purchase," "school renovation"). JavaScript creates a dashboard where the user receives alerts only for what matters to their business.

## 2. Video Podcast "Clips" Curator
### Description
The market for "clip channels" is huge, but finding the exact moment of a joke or controversial statement takes hours.

### Project
Python "listens" to the audio of a long video and identifies emotional peaks (laughter, altered voice tones) or keywords. It suggests exact timestamps. JavaScript creates a quick clipping interface where the user simply clicks "Export."

## 3. Digital Reputation "Cleaner" (Privacy SaaS)
### Description
People post many things they regret or leave trails on forums and social networks from 10 years ago.

### Project
The user connects their accounts (or provides their handle/@). Python performs a deep crawl of old comments, posts, and photos, classifying them by "cancellation risk" or "sensitive content" using AI. JavaScript displays a list of posts where the user can click "Bulk Remove."

## 4. MVP FARMING - AI MVP Generator
### Description
A concept to generate Minimum Viable Products rapidly using artificial intelligence.

### Project
Create MVPs using an advanced pipeline of AI tools.

## 5. Augmented Reality Web Furniture "Fitter"
### Description
Buying furniture online is difficult because you don't know if it will fit in your living room.

### Project
JavaScript uses the mobile camera in the browser (WebXR) to measure the space. Python, on the backend, processes 3D models or generates visualizations of how a specific piece of furniture would look in that environment, adjusting light and shadow to appear real.

## 6. "Newsletter Curation" Automation
### Description
Newsletters are the new marketing "darlings," but selecting the best news of the day requires a lot of work.

### Project
Python reads hundreds of sources (RSS, Twitter, Portals) on a topic (e.g., Artificial Intelligence). It uses AI to rank the 5 most important news items and writes a newsletter draft. JavaScript creates an editor where the user just adjusts the text and clicks "Send to email list."

## 7. The "Price Detective" Browser Extension
### Description
Price comparison tools are common, but you can build one focused on behavior.

### Project
A JavaScript extension that reads the product you are viewing and a Python backend that fetches not only the current price but predicts (using simple AI) if the price will drop in the coming days based on history.

## 8. "Real-Time Investment" Game with Real Data
### Description
Transform the financial or crypto market into an RPG or strategy game.

### Project
A web game where the user receives 10,000 fictional dollars. Python pulls real data from the stock market in real-time. JavaScript creates a game interface (farming style or office simulator) where the player's "city" grows or shrinks as their investments yield results in the real world.

## 9. Game Item "Day Trade" Simulator (Steam Market)
### Description
The market for CS2, Dota, or Rust skins moves millions. Prices fluctuate like stocks.

### Project
A dashboard that monitors the price of specific items in real-time. Python performs technical analysis (moving averages, sales volume), and JavaScript displays "Home Broker" style charts. You can program Python to send "Buy" alerts when an item is below the historical average price.

## 10. Contract and "Fine Print" Analyst
### Description
No one reads Terms of Service or rental contracts, and that is where people get into trouble.

### Project
The user uploads a PDF. Python uses AI to scan the text and highlight "dangerous clauses" (e.g., abusive fines, hidden automatic renewal). JavaScript creates a "side-by-side" interface showing the original contract and the simplified explanation of what each part means in practice.

## 11. Social Pentesting (Fake Phishing)
### Description
Every owner of enterprises spents lots of money trying to see if his workers fall or not in phishing.

### Project
The client sends the emails and details of his business and the tool must try to penetrate its systems with social manipulation techniques.
