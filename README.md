# What are we building?
This repository brings together a collection of projects to be developed mainly during the vacation period, with the goal of practicing fundamental and advanced concepts in the field of tech, exploring new technologies, and turning theoretical ideas into real-world implementations.

# Possible ideas
## 1. Video Podcast "Clips" Curator
### Description
The market for "clip channels" is huge, but finding the exact moment of a joke or controversial statement takes hours.

### Project
Python "listens" to the audio of a long video and identifies emotional peaks (laughter, altered voice tones) or keywords. It suggests exact timestamps. JavaScript creates a quick clipping interface where the user simply clicks "Export."

## 2. MVP FARMING - AI MVP Generator
### Description
A concept to generate Minimum Viable Products rapidly using artificial intelligence.

### Project
Create MVPs using an advanced pipeline of AI tools.

## 3. "Newsletter Curation" Automation
### Description
Newsletters are the new marketing "darlings," but selecting the best news of the day requires a lot of work.

### Project
Python reads hundreds of sources (RSS, Twitter, Portals) on a topic (e.g., Artificial Intelligence). It uses AI to rank the 5 most important news items and writes a newsletter draft. JavaScript creates an editor where the user just adjusts the text and clicks "Send to email list."

## 4. "Real-Time Investment" Game with Real Data
### Description
Transform the financial or crypto market into an RPG or strategy game.

### Project
A web game where the user receives 10,000 fictional dollars. Python pulls real data from the stock market in real-time. JavaScript creates a game interface (farming style or office simulator) where the player's "city" grows or shrinks as their investments yield results in the real world.

## 5. Social Pentesting (Fake Phishing)
### Description
Every owner of enterprises spents lots of money trying to see if his workers fall or not in phishing.

### Project
The client sends the emails and details of his business and the tool must try to penetrate its systems with social manipulation techniques.
