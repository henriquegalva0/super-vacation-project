# What are we building?

## Real-Time Investment Game with Real Data
Although this repository brought together a collection of projects to be developed mainly during the vacation period, with the goal of practicing fundamental and advanced concepts in the field of tech, exploring new technologies, and turning theoretical ideas into real-world implementations, only one idea was selected as our main goal: A Real-Time Investment Game.

## Description
A web game where the user receives fictional dollars. Real data is pulled from the stock market in real-time. A game interface is created where the player's "city" grows or shrinks as their investments yield results in the real world.
